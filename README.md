# helloworld

This project is my adventure in learning how to build an application using Angular2 and served using Electron cross platform package.

I would also like to give tribute to @joaogarin whose project I relied on to provide some guidance regarding the design.

## Dependancies

The application relies on Node.js

## Installation

To install the repository the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xiltch/helloworld
cd helloworld
npm install
npm start
```
